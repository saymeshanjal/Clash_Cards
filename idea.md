# Optimization and Design Improvements

## Overview

This file outlines the changes and optimizations made to the original version of the card game simulation problem.

## Original Approach

The original version of the solution used a brute-force simulation with an incorrect assumption:
- It simulated each game using a deterministic greedy strategy.
- It did not consider **all possible match outcomes** fairly across all valid card distributions.
- For `n = 6`, the number of possible card distributions (20) was not being used correctly, leading to incorrect tie counts.

## Key Changes and Optimizations

### 1. **Exhaustive Enumeration of All Valid Hands**
- We fixed the logic to generate **all valid ways to split the `n` cards** into two hands of equal size (`n/2`) using `std::next_permutation`.
- Ensured that each distribution is **considered exactly once**, representing all unique game setups.

### 2. **Correct Round Simulation Logic**
- For each distribution:
  - Simulate all `r` rounds correctly from a fresh copy of the hand and energy.
  - Each round continues with alternating turns until one player cannot play.
- The result of each full match (i.e., `r` rounds) is counted toward Alex/Boris/win/draw.

### 3. **Greedy Play Logic with Backtracking**
- In each turn, players pick the **smallest playable card > last played** to conserve energy.
- We simulate each round consistently and reset energy and card sets per round.

### 4. **Result Tallying**
- Results of all full game simulations are tallied as:
  - Alex wins if he wins more rounds.
  - Boris wins if he wins more rounds.
  - Tie if both win equal rounds in a game.

### 5. **Corrected Memory and Time Constraints**
- Capped simulation to `n <= 16`, ensuring it's performant.
- Time/memory tracking added via `test_runner.sh`.

## Benefits

- **Accurate output**: Verified outputs now match expected ones including tie counts.
- **Correct complexity**: Acceptable for small `n` using brute-force.
- **Structured simulation**: Well-structured round and turn logic for transparency and debuggability.
- **Test harness integration**: Compatible with `test_runner.sh` and `requirements.json` for performance testing.

## Final Notes

The revised approach is still brute-force but **accurate and optimized** within the allowed limits. Further optimization (e.g., memoization, pruning) can be done if scaling beyond `n=16`.
